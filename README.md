## Built With

Built with Discord.js V13, Discord.js-selfbot @V12 and fs - edited and configured with TS to all work together.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Once you've obtained the node_modules file from the proton drive, and pasted it into the same folder where `package.json` is, `cd` into the UTbot folder

```sh
cd src/UTbot
```

### Installation

1. Install the latest version of Node.js from `https://nodejs.org/en/`

2. Paste the bot tokens you want to use into `tokens.txt`, located inside the UTbot folder

3. In the command line, type:
```sh
node .
```
4. The bot should come online, followed shortly by all the user token accounts logging in.

5. Run the command:
```sh
!!react [Channel ID] [Message ID] [Unicode emoji] [num of bots]
```



## Common problems:

1) The bots wont react:
Make sure the bots are online when the message you want reacting to was sent, make sure the master bot can see your !!react message.
